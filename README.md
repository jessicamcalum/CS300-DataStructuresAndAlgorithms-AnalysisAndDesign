# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved in the projects for this course was to determine which data structure was best to store the data based on the program’s intended use. The scenario in the project was that academic advisors of a Computer Science department at a university wanted a program that they could use to help them with course information when talking to students. They wanted the program to be able to load a list of courses and course information from a file, display a sorted list of all the courses, and display course information and prerequisites for any individual course.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
This problem was approached by first writing pseudocode for three different data structures to complete the desired program tasks. A Big O analysis was performed on each pseudocode to help determine which data structure would be best to use for the program. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had some technical issues that I was able to resolve myself. I used the 24/7 online tutoring services at SNHU when I was having trouble figuring out how to execute certain tasks in the code. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project made me realize how effective and useful it is to plan out your code. It helps to have a good idea of where to start. I also now realize the importance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms for a program. These decisions can make or break your program and learning about how certain algorithms and data structures operate is very useful when it comes to deciding the best algorithms and data structures that will optimize a program’s performance in the long run. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project evolved the way I write programs by making me more aware of the decisions I make regarding data structures and algorithms. These decisions should be made with not only the desired tasks in mind, but also with the future program performance in mind. I also feel that it’s very important to leave comments on code, and keep the code organized and neatly formatted when coding anything. This helps to make things less confusing for collaborators and your future self.
